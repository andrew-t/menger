*Maybe the world's first 2.7D website.*

[MegaMenger](http://www.megamenger.com) is a maths-communication project aimed at building a giant 'distributed fractal' from around a million business cards. Six cards make a cube, and twenty cubes can be put together to make a 'level one Menger sponge', which is to say, a cube with a hole through the middle of each face. In the same way, twenty level one sponges can be put together to make a level two sponge. (A blank sponge can be thought of as a level zero sponge.)

A few locations around the world have built 1.5m-tall, 90kg level three monsters. The aim is to get enough level threes, plus enough level twos, level ones and various bits of sponge, to have created a global level four sponge (even though the level four will never be brought together). I belive we are currently approaching 80% of the level four.

This website is the picture gallery for the MegaMenger website: it is itself a Menger Sponge, with the level three sponges displayed on the large outer faces, the level twos on the smaller divisions of the centre cube, and the level ones another level down again. The whole thing gently rotates and faces can be clicked to show details of a particular build.

## Still to do

The website is currently waiting on updated information from all the build sites, and thumbnail versions of the images for the faces, as the current version uses the full-size images which load and render more slowly than I would like.
